# Report types explained!

This article provides a detailed explanation of our report types. First and foremost, it provides information about the individual types and roughly explains our handling and our working method / approach, which differs depending on the type.

## Basics

So let's start with the basics. Why are there different types? This is a very easy question to answer: By distinguishing between different errors, we can optimize our work process and set priorities depending on the report. For example, errors when enabling the plugin are prioritized over a bypass, because we want to ensure that our product runs at all times.

The distribution of tasks, future planning and daily task lists also depend to a certain extent on the reported errors. It is therefore of great interest to us to read through each of your reports, process them and finally correct them or, in the case of a suggestion or question, to consider it or answer the question as quickly as possible.

## False Flags | What are they and how do I report them?

### What is a False Flag
A false flag is a false detection by the Anticheat where a 100% legitimate user is detected by the Anticheat for cheats.<br>
<em>Also, it should be noted that the version of the server is supported by LulzHack according to the documentation. </em>

### But what does <em>"100% legitimate"</em> mean?
This means that it is a user who is playing without any modification, which is not only graphical, and has not opened any external programs that have access to the client process. For example, the use of AutoClicker or external cheat clients counts as external access to the process.

### Describe False Flags
False flags are the most complicated form of an error, as they can be affected by many different situations and conditions, such as server version, client version, lags and much more.
Therefore they should be described as detailed as possible and always shown with <strong>a video</strong> so that it is easier for us to reproduce them for test purposes.
