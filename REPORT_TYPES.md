# Report types explained!

This article provides a detailed explanation of our report types. First and foremost, it provides information about the individual types and roughly explains our handling and our working method / approach, which differs depending on the type.

## Basics

So let's start with the basics. Why are there different types? This is a very easy question to answer: By distinguishing between different errors, we can optimize our work process and set priorities depending on the report. For example, errors when enabling the plugin are prioritized over a bypass, because we want to ensure that our product runs at all times.

The distribution of tasks, future planning and daily task lists also depend to a certain extent on the reported errors. It is therefore of great interest to us to read through each of your reports, process them and finally correct them or, in the case of a suggestion or question, to consider it or answer the question as quickly as possible.

## 1. False Flags | What are they and how do I report them?

### What is a False Flag
A false flag is a false detection by the Anticheat where a 100% legitimate user is detected by the Anticheat for cheats.<br>
<em>Also, it should be noted that the version of the server is supported by LulzHack according to the documentation. </em>

### But what does <em>"100% legitimate"</em> mean?
This means that it is a user who is playing without any modification, which is not only graphical, and has not opened any external programs that have access to the client process. For example, the use of AutoClicker or external cheat clients counts as external access to the process.

### Describe False Flags
False flags are the most complicated form of an error, as they can be affected by many different situations and conditions, such as server version, client version, lags and much more.
Therefore they should be described as detailed as possible and always shown with <strong>a video</strong> so that it is easier for us to reproduce them for test purposes.

## 2. Bypass

A bypass is a cheat which is not recognized by the anticheat despite an existing check for this cheat. The reporting of a bypass consists of recording a video in which you can clearly see the achieved advantage and reproduce. It is also helpful to specify the client name + the settings of the module if this is not shown in the video. 

Every message of possible bypasses helps us a lot to improve the anticheat, so that we can guarantee the protection against hackers as good as possi

## 3. Console Error

A console error is an error about the plugin itself or about interaction with other plugins on the server. Such errors can lead to major problems in internal processes, which can lead to checks not working properly. 

To report such an error correctly, we need the Stacktrace (error). You can add this to your report uploaded on log.lulzhack.xyz.
___

## 4. Crash

This is an error that causes the server to crash or restart. Errors of this class have the highest priority in our workflow and will be fixed as soon as possible.

Also for this we need a stacktrace (if available) and further information about the whole server structure. The required information can be created in a file with the /lulzhack dump command and then uploaded to log.lulzhack.xyz.
___

## 5. Activation Error

If the plugin is not enabled properly, this can be due to various problems or incompatibilities. To fix such errors, we need the complete server log, as well as a list of installed plugins.

## 6. Suggestion/Question

You can also use our Issue Tracker to submit suggestions for the Anticheat. These will then be recorded, discussed and, if necessary, added by us. This includes suggestions for new features, checks or other creative ideas on your part.

If you have any questions, you can also ask them via the Issue Tracker. Please keep in mind that we also have a Discord Server on which we are happy to answer questions. You can find the link to our Discord Server [here](discord.lulzhack.xyz)
